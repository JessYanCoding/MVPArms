## A common Architecture for Android Applications developing based on MVP，integrates many Open Source Projects( like Dagger2,Rxjava,Retrofit... ),to make your developing quicker and easier.

## Usage
> New Project
>> If you are building a new project, directly to the entire project **clone** (or download), as **app** as the main **Module** (It is recommended to remove the **arms Module** and use **Gradle** to [depend](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArms/wiki#1.1) on this framework remotely for easy updates), then the package name into their own package name , **app Module** contains the package structure can be used directly, a mainstream `MVP` +` Dagger2` + `Retrofit` +` Rxjava` framework so easy to build successful, and now you refer **Mvp** Package under the **UserActivity** format,[Use Template to automatically generate MVP, Dagger2 related classes](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArmsTemplate),With access to [Wiki documents](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArms/wiki) slowly grasp the framework to see more articles as soon as possible in the project to use it, in practice, learning is the fastest

> Old Project
>> [Old projects would like to introduce this framework, you can refer to the Wiki documentation, written in great detail](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArms/wiki)

* The use of these technologies for the latter part of the project maintenance and iterative, especially large projects is very helpful, but is to develop a pre-write a page to write a lot of `MVP`,` Dagger2` class and interface, which is indeed a headache for the development of pre- Now the framework has been able to [Template](https://github.com/JessYanCoding/MVPArmsTemplate) automatically generate some `MVP`,` Dagger2` template code, and now we can very easily use the framework.

* Use this frame comes with automatic adaptation function, please refer to [AndroidAutoLayout](https://github.com/hongyangAndroid/AndroidAutoLayout).

* This framework uses `RxPermissions` for rights management (adaptation Android 6.0), and provides a PermissionUtil tool class line of code to implement the permission request.

* This framework does not provide any third-party libraries associated with the **UI**(except for the [`AndroidAutoLayout`](https://github.com/hongyangAndroid/AndroidAutoLayout) screen adaptation scheme).
